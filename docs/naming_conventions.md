# Naming Conventions & Recommendations
## Documentation
The [documentation format](./documentation_format.md) is recommended for maintaining well-documented functions.

## Files
### Name
The name of function files and folders should only contain the following characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `.`.

> [!NOTE]
> The reason for this is that different operating systems treat file and folder names differently due to casing or certain special characters. The restriction to this set of characters ensures that files and folders are treated the same on all operating systems and that it is universally readable.

Globally predefined function file names:
- `load.mcfunction` This function is called at every start
- `tick.mcfunction` This function is called every tick

### Structure
Function files and folders should be written in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). Numbers within the function or folder name should **not** be used for numbering or to enforce a certain structure.

Organize your files into "modules". Modules are folders which contain either/or a `tick.mcfunction` and `load.mcfunction` function file.
The `tick.mcfunction` function file serves as the "entry point" for the module and the `load.mcfunction` function file serves as the "setup".

> [!NOTE]
> The "modules" ensure a clear global structure for the entire project. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the source code and further work on it.

## Content
### Uninstall or Removal
Your datapack should always provide a `<namespace>:uninstall` function for the user.

```yml
Datapack/
├─ pack.mcmeta
└─ data/
   └─ <namespace>/
      └─ function/
         └─ uninstall.mcfunction
```

- `<namespace>:uninstall` This function is responsible for calling all the remove functions to leave no artifacts of the datapack behind. This function should also disable the datapack after calling all remove functions.

> [!NOTE]
> In the real world, almost every program provides an uninstall file in addition to the installation file. So datapacks should also always provide an uninstall function.

### Advancements
If your datapack creates advancements, the following directory structure should exist:

#### Simple Structure
If you have a simple advancement that can be easily invoked and does not require any additional functionality, please use the following directory structure:

```yml
Datapack/
├─ pack.mcmeta
└─ data/
   └─ <namespace>/
      ├─ advancement/
      │  └─ <...>/
      │     └─ <advancement name>.json
      └─ function/
         └─ advancement/
            ├─ reset.mcfunction
            └─ <...>/
               └─ <advancement name>.mcfunction
```

- `<...>` The advancment can also be nested in subdirectories. The directory structure should be the same to avoid naming collisions.
- `<namespace>:advancement/reset` This function should be called from the `#minecraft:load.json` file when the datapack is started. All advancements for each player are reset by this function.
- `<namespace>:advancement/<...>/<advancement name>` This function should be called from the `<namespace>:<...>/<advancement name>.json` file when the advancement is triggered, and serves as an entry point from which to call other functions. There should be no complex logic built into this function.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not want to force the user into creating a separate sub-folder for each advancement if they only want to call one function, which is why functions for advancements can also be called directly via the name. If the advancement requires more complex logic for the functionality, then you should use the [complex structure](#complex-structure).

#### Complex Structure
If your Advancement is more complex and you need additional functions for functionality please use the following directory structure:

```yml
Datapack/
├─ pack.mcmeta
└─ data/
   └─ <namespace>/
      ├─ advancement/
      │  └─ <...>/
      │     └─ <advancement name>.json
      └─ function/
         └─ advancement/
            ├─ reset.mcfunction
            └─ <...>/
               └─ <advancement name>/
                  ├─ <additional functions...>.mcfunction
                  └─ trigger.mcfunction
```

- `<...>` The advancment can also be nested in subdirectories. The directory structure should be the same to avoid naming collisions.
- `<namespace>:advancement/reset` This function should be called from the `#minecraft:load.json` file when the datapack is started. All advancements for each player are reset by this function.
- `<namespace>:advancement/<...>/<advancement name>/<additional functions...>` These functions should be specific to this advancement and not complex.
- `<namespace>:advancement/<...>/<advancement name>/trigger` This function should be called from the `<namespace>:<...>/<advancement name>.json` file when the advancement is triggered, and serves as an entry point from which to call other functions. There should be no complex logic built into this function.

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes an advancement needs additional functions for the actual functionality. If this is the case, we do not want the user to separate the functionality from the actual advancement, as this functionality should still be part of the actual advancement. If this functionality is not part of the actual advancement, then you should use the [simple structure](#simple-structure) and move the functionality to another location within your application. This ensures a clean structure.

### Scoreboards
If your datapack creates scoreboards, the following directory structure should exist:

```yml
Datapack/
├─ pack.mcmeta
└─ data/
   └─ <namespace>/
      └─ function/
         └─ scoreboard/
            ├─ add.mcfunction
            └─ remove.mcfunction
```

- `<namespace>:scoreboard/add` This function should be called by the `#minecraft:load.json` when the datapack is started. All scoreboards are created in this file and initial values are set for the scoreboards.
- `<namespace>:scoreboard/remove` This function should be called by the [`<namespace>:uninstall`](#uninstall-or-removal) function when the datapack is removed. In this file, all scoreboards that were previously created are removed so that no artifacts are left behind.

### Storages
If your datapack creates storages, the following directory structure should exist:

```yml
Datapack/
├─ pack.mcmeta
└─ data/
   └─ <namespace>/
      └─ function/
         └─ storage/
            ├─ add.mcfunction
            └─ remove.mcfunction
```

- `<namespace>:storage/add` This function should be called by the `#minecraft:load.json` file when the Datapack is started. All initial values for a storage are set in this file.
- `<namespace>:storage/remove` This function should be called by the [`<namespace>:uninstall`](#uninstall-or-removal) function when the datapack is removed. In this file, all storages that were previously created are removed so that no artifacts are left behind. It is also recommended to inform the user that after removing the storages the `storage_<namespace>.dat` inside the `saves/<world>` folder can be deleted, because Minecraft doesn't remove empty storage files by itself.

### Items
If your Datapack provides items for a player, the following functions should be available to the player:

```yml
Datapack/
├─ pack.mcmeta
└─ data/
   └─ <namespace>/
      └─ function/
         ├─ item/
         │  └─ all/
         │     └─ give.mcfunction
         └─ app/
            └─ <...>/
               └─ <module>/
                  └─ give.mcfunction
```

- `<namespace>:item/all/give` Gives the player all available items provided by the datapack.
- `<namespace>:<...>/<module>/give` Gives the player all/the available items for the respective module.<br>
  > For example, `<namespace>:app/blocks/glowing_dirt/give` would give the player the items for the module `glowing_dirt`.
